# html-css-for-begginers

**This repository is for begginers who want to learn HTML and CSS.**

- Every folder is a new project, focused in one aspect of HTML / CSS.
- Which aspect is in the folder's name itself. For instance, "content-sectioning" makes reference to the "content sectioning elements as refered in the [HTML reference from mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element). No further instruction needed, unless an extra README.md is provided.
- The goal is to make a new website from every folder.
- For that every folder provides at least a design in mobile version, sometimes in desktop version.
- Try to be as precise as possible, but don't obsess over it. The goal is to learn, not to make a perfect website. Learning is a process over years, not a short-term goal.

**Disclaimer:**

I'm not a dessigner by any means. For this repo I try to make designs that are clear and functional, and at the same time as pedagogical and close to reality as I'm in a very short time. Please, don't take them as a reference for your own projects. I'm sure you can do better.
